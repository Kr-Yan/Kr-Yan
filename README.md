### Key Projects

- **[Machine-Learning-for-Surface-Coating-Optimization
](https://github.com/Kr-Yan/Machine-Learning-for-Surface-Coating-Optimization)**: Used R and ML skills like classification, regression and optimization to train models to predict the fraction of corroded surface.

- **[Stack Overflow-Inspired Web Application](https://github.com/Kr-Yan/Stack-Overflow-Inspired-Web-Application)**: This project aims to design and implement a full-stack web application with functionality inspired by Stack Overflow. In addition, we practices in software design and modularization, utilized end-to-end testing and implemented a CI pipeline.

- **[Fake News Lab: Analyzing Covid-19 Myths](https://github.com/Kr-Yan/Fake-News-Lab-Analyzing-Covid-19-Myths)** : This project aims analyze the most discussed topics and keywords surrounding Covid-19 myths using ML techniques. We employed Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and text summarization methods to extract key insights from a dataset of Covid-19 related discussions.

- **[Graphical Image Manipulation and Enhancement](https://github.com/Kr-Yan/Graphical-Image-Manipulation-and-Enhancement-Project)** : designed a view for your image processing application, featuring a graphical user interface, which allow a user to interactively load, process and save images. use Java Swing to build the graphical user interface.
    
- **[Formula-One-F1-Database-Management-System](https://github.com/Kr-Yan/Formula-One-F1-Database-Management-System)**:Created a SQL relational database that captures and organizes extensive data related to Formula One racing. The database stores information and offers users the ability to query and analyze various aspects of the sport in the Python application.

- **[Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Clustering and Classification Models](https://github.com/Kr-Yan/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Using-Clustering-and-Classification-Models))**:This project explore factors that differentiate between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions using ML technique. By applying clustering and classification models, ensemble learning, and feature engineering, we seek to identify key patterns and variables that are most indicative of fraudulent behavior.
